# Backing up Neo4j Containers

[NOTE]
**This approach supports Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure storage, and assumes you have credentials and wish
to store your backups on those cloud storage systems**.  If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the backup
script for your desired cloud storage method, but the approach will work for any backup location.

[NOTE]
**This approach works only for Neo4j 4.0+**.   The backup tool and the
DBMS itself changed quite a lot between 3.5 and 4.0, and the approach
here will likely not work for older databases without substantial 
modification.

[NOTE]
If you are upgrading to the helm chart 4.1.3-1 or later from an earlier version, double check
this documentation; the syntax of using the backup chart has changed a bit to accomodate multiple
clouds.  This documentation applies only to 4.1.3-1 and forward.

## Background & Important Information

### Required Neo4j Config

This is provided for you out of the box by the helm chart, but if you
customize you should bear these requirements in mind:

* `dbms.backup.enabled=true`
* `dbms.backup.listen_address=0.0.0.0:6362`

The default for Neo4j is to listen only on 127.0.0.1, which will not
work as other containers would not be able to access the backup port.

### Backup Pointers

All backups will turn into .tar.gz files with date strings when they were taken, such as: `neo4j-2020-06-16-12:32:57.tar.gz`.  They are named after the database
they are a backup of. 

When you take a backup, you will get both the dated version, and a "latest" copy,
e.g. the above file will also be copied to `neo4j/neo4j-latest.tar.gz` in the same bucket.

[NOTE]
**Reminder: Each time you take a backup, the latest file will be overwritten**.

The purpose of doing this is to have a stable name in storage where the latest
backup can always be found, without losing any of the previous backups.

### Neo4j Backs Up Databases, Not the DBMS

In Neo4j 4.0, the system can be multidatabase; most systems have at least 2 DBs,
"system" and "neo4j".  *These need to be backed up and restored individually*.

## Steps to Take a Backup

### Create a service key secret to access cloud storage

First you want to create a kubernetes secret that contains the content of your account service key.  This key must have permissions to access the bucket and backup set that you're trying to restore. 

#### Azure

- You must create the credential file and this file should look like this:
```azure-credentials.sh
export ACCOUNT_NAME=<NAME_STORAGE_ACCOUNT>
export ACCOUNT_KEY=<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY>
```

If you're unsure what the account key secret should be, you can recover it with the following command: 

```
ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list --resource-group "$AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP" --account-name "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT" --query [0].value -o tsv)
```

- You have to create a secret for this file
```shell
kubectl create secret generic neo4j-azure-credentials \
    --from-file=credentials=azure-credentials.sh
```

#### AWS

- You must create the credential file and this file should look like this:
```aws-credentials
[default]
region=
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```

- You have to create a secret for this file
```shell
kubectl create secret generic neo4j-aws-credentials \
    --from-file=credentials=aws-credentials
```

#### GCP

Download a JSON formatted service key from Google Cloud that looks like this:

```gcp-credentials.json
{
  "type": "",
  "project_id": "",
  "private_key_id": "",
  "private_key": "",
  "client_email": "",
  "client_id": "",
  "auth_uri": "",
  "token_uri": "",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
  "client_x509_cert_url": ""
}

```

- You have to create a secret for this file
```shell
kubectl create secret generic neo4j-gcp-credentials \
    --from-file=credentials=gcp-credentials.json
```

[NOTE]
**'--from-file=credentials=<your-config-path>' here is important**; the credentials under the secret must be named `credentials`

### Running a Backup

The backup method is itself a mini-helm chart, and so to run a backup, you just
do this as a minimal required example:

**AWS**

```shell
helm install my-neo4j-backup . \
    --set neo4jaddr=my-neo4j.default.svc.cluster.local:6362 \
    --set bucket=s3://my-bucket \
    --set database="neo4j\,system" \
    --set cloudProvider=aws \
    --set secretName=neo4j-aws-credentials \
    --set jobSchedule="0 */12 * * *"
```

**GCP**
```shell
helm install my-neo4j-backup . \
    --set neo4jaddr=my-neo4j.default.svc.cluster.local:6362 \
    --set bucket=gs://my-bucket \
    --set database="neo4j\,system" \
    --set cloudProvider=gcp \
    --set secretName=neo4j-gcp-credentials \
    --set jobSchedule="0 */12 * * *"
```

[NOTE]
**This command must be run in 'https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-helm/tree/master/tools/backup'**


If all goes well, after a period of time when the Kubernetes Job is complete, you
will simply see the backup files appear in the designated bucket, under directories named
after the databases you backed up.

[NOTE]
**If your backup does not appear, consult the job's pod container logs to find out
why**

**If you want to get a hot backup before schedule, you can use this command:**

```shell
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/my-neo4j-backup-job neo4j-hot-backup
```

**Required parameters**

* `neo4jaddr` pointing to an address where your cluster is running, ideally the
discovery address.
* `bucket` where you want the backup copied to.  It should be `gs://bucketname` or `s3://bucketname`.
* `databases` a comma separated list of databases to back up.  The default is
`neo4j,system`.  If your DBMS has many individual databases, you should change this.
* `cloudProvider` Which cloud service do you want to keep backups on?(gcp or aws)
* `secretName` the name of the secret you created (neo4j-gcp-credentials|neo4j-aws-credentials)
* `jobSchedule` what intervals do you want to take backup? It should be cron like "0 */12 * * *". You can set your own schedule(https://crontab.guru/#0_*/12_*_*_*)

**Optional environment variables**

All of the following variables mimic the command line options
for https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/backup/performing/#backup-performing-command[neo4j-admin backup documented here]

* `pageCache`
* `heapSize`
* `fallbackToFull` (true/false), default=true
* `checkConsistency` (true/false), default=true
* `checkIndexes` (true/false) default=true
* `checkGraph` (true/false), default=true
* `checkLabelScanStore` (true/false), default=true
* `checkPropertyOwners` (true/false), default=false

### Exit Conditions

If the backup of any of the individual databases mentioned in the database parameters
fails, the entire container will exit with a non-zero exit code and fail.

**Note**: it is possible for Neo4j backups to succeed, but with failed consistency checks.
This will be noted in the logs, but will operationally behave as a successful backup.
