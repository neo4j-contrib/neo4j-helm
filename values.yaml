# Readiness probes will send a kill signal to the container if
# it fails enough times.  It's therefore very important
# that initialDelaySeconds give the cluster time to form, because
# if readiness probes start immediately after container start,
# they may end up not forming quickly enough and getting killed.
# DEPENDENCY:  If you're running in standalone mode, the single machine
# starts much faster.  You could set initialDelaySeconds to something like
# 30 and it would be OK for a stand-alone machine, but not for a cluster.
