  # This implementation was inspired by this comment: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/1869#issuecomment-595456178
  # And found in this post which describes the problem: https://suraj.io/post/how-to-gracefully-kill-kubernetes-jobs-with-a-sidecar/
  # This sidecar monitors the backup process that runs the main job and kills the consul-proxy once backup is finished.
  # Note that it's necessary to set `shareProcessNamespace: true` in `spec.template.spec` for this to work.
